### Tech

Saviour was created with [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app), uses [firebase](https://www.npmjs.com/package/firebase) for persistence and [Material-UI](http://www.material-ui.com/#/) as user interface library.

For charts we have [ChartJS](http://www.chartjs.org/).

This is still just a project in it's very beginning and there's much to fix before it's really of any use.
