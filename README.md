# saviour
A planner and visualizer for savers, but mostly a game of create-react-app.

## Background
I needed a project to get more into react and visualizing my saving plan for buying an apartment seemed like a fun project.

Visualizing gets to be a gamification in itself and helps keep the eyes on the target.

## Run

```js

npm install
npm start

// open browser to http://localhost:8080/webpack-dev-server/

```
